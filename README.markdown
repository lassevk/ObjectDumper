This project contains code to dump an object and its contents
for debugging purposes to a TextWriter, a file, the Debug output,
or just get hold of it as a string.

Repository and project location: [CodePlex][1]  
Maintainer: [Lasse V. Karlsen][2]

**NOTE**: This code is still very, *very*, much in flux. Do not use this
in anything remotely related to production code. Expect methods to gain
new parameters, be overloaded, or to disappear completely.

**You have been warned!**

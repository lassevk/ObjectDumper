The examples that are shipped as part of the ObjectDump
[repository][1] requires [LINQPad][2] to run, a free tool made
by the author of [C# 40 in a Nutshell][3], a [O'Reilly][4]
book about C# 4.0, LINQ and various other topics.

Ensure that you load up the solution file in Visual Studio 2015,
and do a full rebuild for the Debug target before testing any
of the examples. They rely on the binary produced as part of the
build output.
